# docker-utils
Wrapper around the docker command for fast building, deployment and more. It is a single file, written in python3.10.

This is a script that I actually use on my servers, and is not really intended for outside use, but you are welcome to try it out anyway !

## Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/Nicolas-Reyland/docker-utils
cd docker-utils
./install.sh # creates a symbolic link '~/.local/bin/docker-utils'
```
You should have `$HOME/.local/bin` in your PATH as well as python3.10 installed.

## Usage
Please refer to `docker-utils --help` for more information, but you are welcomed to add your own *modules* (take a look at the self-explanatory code).
